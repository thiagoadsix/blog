## **Prerequisites**

- Mention the tools that need to be installed before proceeding:
  - Golang (at least version 1.18+)
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - air (installation instructions will be provided later)

## **Project Setup**

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir golang-docker-air
cd golang-docker-air
```

Initialize a new Go module:

```go
go mod init github.com/yourusername/golang-docker-air
```

Create a simple `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## **Installing Air**

Use the following command to install **Air** for live reloading. This instruction works fine for Unix systems, you can look for more informations [here](https://github.com/air-verse/air) on **Air** documentation.

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/air-verse/air/master/install.sh | sh -s
```

## Configure Air

Run `air init`, and will be created a file on root of your project called `.air.toml`.

Now update **cmd** value property from **.air.toml** to:

Before:

```toml
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
```

After:

```toml
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ./cmd/app/main.go"
```

Now, let's create a directory `cmd/app` on the root of the project, and move our `main.go` file to this new directory.

## **Setting up Docker and Docker Compose**

Create a **Dockerfile** to define the Go environment:

```docker
FROM golang:1.22.5
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app
# Install air for hot reloading
RUN go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
# Copy go.mod and go.sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod tidy && go mod verify
# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .
# Install air configuration
COPY .air.toml .air.toml
# Command to run air for hot reloading
CMD ["air"]
```

Create a **docker-compose.yaml** file to define the services:

```docker
services:
	api:
		build: .
		env_file:
			- .env
		ports:
			- "3000:3000"
		volumes:
			- .:/app
			- /app/tmp
		networks:
			- backend

volumes:
	api_volume:
networks:
	backend:
		driver: bridge
```

# Testing

Now, let's add `chi` package to make the test, just to try to have something close to a real scenario.

## Install chi package

Run the following command below to install `chi` package to our project. Link from `chi` repository is [here](https://github.com/go-chi/chi).

```go
go get -u github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
```

## Update main file

Now, let's just add the following code to our `main.go` file (**cmd/app/main.go**):

```go
package  main

import (
"fmt"
"log"
"net/http"

"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func  main() {
	r  :=  chi.NewRouter()
	fmt.Println("Server starting at http://localhost:3000")

	err  :=  http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
	if  err  !=  nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed: %v", err)
	}
}
```

## Run docker compose

Now, let's just run the following command on our terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

And we'll have something like this:

```bash

```

Now let's add a ðŸš€ at the and of our log message, just to show that our container will be reloaded:

```go
package  main

import (
"fmt"
"log"
"net/http"

"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
)

func  main() {
	r  :=  chi.NewRouter()
	fmt.Println("Server starting at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€")

	err  :=  http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
	if  err  !=  nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed: %v", err)
	}
}
```

This is our terminal:

```bash

# **Conclusion**

By following the steps in this guide, you've successfully set up a Golang development environment with live reloading using Air and Docker Compose. This setup streamlines your workflow, allowing you to focus on writing and testing your code without the need to restart your application manually.

With the combination of Docker Compose and Air, you now have a flexible, containerized development environment that can be easily scaled or adapted to fit more complex applications. Whether you're building a simple API or a larger microservices architecture, this approach ensures your development process remains efficient and productive.

Feel free to expand on this foundation by integrating other tools or services, exploring different Go packages, or customizing your Docker setup. The possibilities are vast, and this setup is just the beginning of what you can achieve with Go and Docker.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
